> LilURL | A lil URL Shortener

**This is a work in progress and doesn't quite work *yet*** (it does fundamentally do a thing though but isn't at all user friendly)

## TODO
- [ ] Move the new URL to a new page so that it can *actually* be displayed to the user (`/n/`)
- [ ] Work out routing for opening a short link
  - [ ] Create a new page `/o/` that becomes base for opening a short page
  - [ ] Edit `.htaccess` to so you don't have to specify params ([info here](https://www.codexworld.com/php-url-shortener-library-create-short-url/))
- [ ] Add about page
- [ ] Make styling look better
